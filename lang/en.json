    "isSignupRequired": "Is online registration mandatory?",
    "isSignupRequiredAnswer": "Yes. Your personal data will have to be entered at the hotel reception, along with the participant's contact details for future information about the event. If you are unable to register online, you can ask the church group registrar to do it for you.",
    "isOnlineSignupEnough": "Is online registration sufficient or is there more to do?",
    "isOnlineSignupEnoughAnswer": "Online registration is the first step and helps us to already reserve the necessary places and to know in real time the number of participants and the closing time for registration. The second step of registration is to register with the church's designated group leader or youth leader in the church. Registration is done by paying the full amount, at which time the room allocation is also made.",
    "whoCreatesRooms": "Who is in charge of the reservation and room assignment?",
    "whoCreatesRoomsAnswer": "The group leader of your church will allocate rooms. If a room is not full, it will be filled with participants from other groups according to age and gender criteria. Ideally, participants should already be paired with their friends and fill a room on their own at the time of registration.",
    "whenIsTheInscriptionConsideredSafe": "When is registration considered safe?",
    "whenIstheInscriptionConsideredSafeAnsware": "After paying the group leader in full and assigning the room. Please note: Online registration on the Conference website is only the first step. Without payment of the registration fee and room assignment by the group leader, registration is not considered complete.",
    "whenIsTheInscriptionDeadline": "Until when is it possible to register?",
    "whenIsTheInscriptionDeadlineAnsware": "The deadline is 27 October, but registrations can end even earlier if the available places are exhausted. We have around 3,000 reserved places and once they are sold out, no more registrations will be accepted. This is why online registration helps us to know exactly how many participants there will be and when the registration list will close.",
    "ChurchNotInList": "If my church is not in the list of churches in the Conference link, what should I do?",
    "ChurchNotInListAnswer": "Registration takes place at church level through the responsible person appointed by the church leadership or youth leader. If there are other participants from your church, you can ask for your church to be listed in the Conference directory by sending a message to +39 380 639 7797. If you are the only participant from your church, you can join the list of the nearest church, where you can pay the participation fee and book a room. If you do not have this option, you will be placed on a special list that uses the same phone number for communication.",
    "singleDayParticipationQuestion": "Can I sign up for a day?",
    "singleDayParticipationAnswer": "This is currently not possible. Registration is now only for full participation in the Conference sessions with full payment for the two days. Partial registrations will only be accepted if there are still places available after 28 October.",
    "participateWithoutHousingAndMeal": "Can I attend the conference without paying the fee for meals and accommodation?",
    "participateWithoutHousingAndMealAnswer": "Not yet. Places are limited and reserved for those who register and pay the full registration fee. Only a few days before the Conference will we know if there are still places available in the Conference hall. The hall has a maximum capacity of 3,000 seats and if these are occupied by those staying in the Complex, we will not be able to accept entry without a reservation. The status of registrations and availability of places will be regularly updated on the Conference website.",
    "minimumAgeQuestion": "What is the minimum age?",
    "minimumAgeAnswer": "We encourage the participation of young people and teenagers over the age of 14, but exceptions may be made if the group leader or family takes responsibility for supervision during the Conference or during the trip. The participation of minors in the Conference and their travel must be made on the basis of a power of attorney signed by the parents if the minor is not accompanied by parents. This power of attorney will be provided by and must be handed over to the group leader.",
    "amountToPayForChildren": "What is the participation fee for children?",
    "amountToPayForChildrenAnswer": "Children under 3 years of age are exempt from the participation fee. All those who have already reached the age of 3 will pay the full amount for the room type.",
    "specialProgramforKids": "Will there be special programmes for children?",
    "specialProgramforKidsAnswer": "If there are families with children, we will organise special programmes with them through the Sunday School Department during the Conference sessions.",
    "reimbursementQuestion": "Can I ask for a refund of the registration fee?",
    "reimbursementAnswer": "After 27 October, the closing date for registrations, no refunds can be made as food and accommodation bookings have already been made and registrations are considered final. Until 24 October, replacements may be made for those who withdraw for serious objective reasons analysed by the group leader.",
    "onlinePayment": "Can I pay online?",
    "onlinePaymentAnswer": "Personal payment of the Conference fee must be made to the group leader at the church in the manner determined by the group leader. The group leader may, in turn, for the whole group, make the payment online as instructed by the organisers or at the reception desk on arrival of the group. Those who pay online in advance are requested to bring the receipt to the reception.",

Technical cookies are those used solely for the purpose of 'transmitting a communication over an electronic communications network, or to the extent strictly necessary for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide that service' (see Art. 122, paragraph 1, of the Code). They are not used for additional purposes and are normally installed directly by the website owner or manager. They can be divided into browsing or session cookies, which ensure normal navigation and use of the website; analytics cookies, considered equivalent to technical cookies when used directly by the site manager to collect information, in aggregate form, on the number of users and how they visit the site; functionality cookies, which allow the user to navigate according to a set of selected criteria in order to improve the service provided to them. For the installation of these cookies, the prior consent of users is not required, although there is still an obligation to provide information pursuant to Art. 13 of the Code, which the site manager, if only using such devices, may provide in the manner they deem most appropriate.\n\n- Profiling cookies. Profiling cookies are aimed at creating profiles related to the user and are used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the user while browsing the web. Due to the particular invasiveness that such devices may have within the private sphere of users, European and Italian regulations require that the user be adequately informed about their use and thus express their valid consent. They are referred to in Art. 122 of the Code, which provides that 'the storage of information in the terminal equipment of a contractor or a user or access to information already stored is permitted only on the condition that the contractor or user has given their consent after being informed in the simplified manner referred to in Article 13, paragraph 3' (Art. 122, paragraph 1, of the Code).
